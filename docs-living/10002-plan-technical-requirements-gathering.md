# Technical Requirements Gathering Phase

## Objective

Define and document all technical requirements for the chat system implementation.

## Tasks

### 0. Authentication, Error Handling, Logging

It's my opinion these three systems need to be well defined before moving on to any features.
They may be further refined ("Application Observability") but that will layer on top of logging/error handling.

### 1. WebSocket Server Requirements

- [ ] Define WebSocket server architecture
- [ ] Document connection handling requirements
- [ ] Define message protocol specifications
- [ ] Document reconnection strategies
- [ ] Define error handling requirements
- [ ] Document security requirements
- [ ] Define load balancing needs
- [ ] Document scaling requirements

### 2. Database Requirements

- [ ] Define data models for:
  - [ ] Users and authentication
  - [ ] Chat rooms
  - [ ] Messages
  - [ ] File attachments
  - [ ] Robot interactions
- [ ] Document indexing requirements
- [ ] Define query patterns
- [ ] Document performance requirements
- [ ] Define backup and recovery needs
- [ ] Document data retention policies

### 3. Message Persistence Requirements

- [ ] Define message storage strategy
- [ ] Document real-time delivery requirements
- [ ] Define message ordering guarantees
- [ ] Document message history requirements
- [ ] Define message search capabilities
- [ ] Document message update/delete policies

### 4. Monitoring and Observability

- [ ] Define logging requirements
- [ ] Document metrics collection needs
- [ ] Define alerting requirements
- [ ] Document tracing requirements
- [ ] Define performance monitoring needs
- [ ] Document error tracking requirements

## Deliverables

1. WebSocket server specification document
2. Database schema and requirements document
3. Message persistence strategy document
4. Monitoring and observability specification
5. Technical architecture diagram
6. API contract documentation

## Timeline

- Estimated duration: 2-3 weeks
- Priority: High (Required for implementation planning)

## Dependencies

- Completion of Document Review Phase
- Access to existing system metrics
- Understanding of current system load

## Success Criteria

- All technical requirements are clearly defined
- Architecture decisions are documented with rationale
- Performance requirements are quantified
- Security requirements are comprehensive
- Scalability requirements are defined
- Monitoring requirements are complete

## Expected outputs

Each 'feature' should have its own document. They should be named as `11[nnn]-[feature-name]-plan.md`, example `11003-websocket-plan.md`. All of those documents MUST be in the documentation-living directory (sibling to this file).

The file numbers should be sequential and items should be arranged in the order they need to be completed. They should count by five to make room for future revision notes (newly discovered perquisites).

Example:
Given the two features:

```
\#\#\# 0. Authentication, Error Handling, Logging

\#\#\# 1. WebSocket Server Requirements
```

I would expect to see files:
11001-authentication-error-logging-plan.md
11005-websocket-plan.md
