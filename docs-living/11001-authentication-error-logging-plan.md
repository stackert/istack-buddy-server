# Authentication, Error Handling & Logging Plan

## Overview

Foundation systems that must be implemented before any chat features. These provide security, reliability, and observability for the entire system.

## Implementation Order

**Priority: 1 (Foundation)**
**Dependencies: None**
**Required Before: All other features**

## Features Included

### 1. Authentication System

- HTTP POST authentication endpoint returning JWT tokens
- JWT token validation for WebSocket connections
- Permission-based access control using domain:function:action pattern
- User and group management
- Guest vs Employee role separation

### 2. Error Handling Framework

- Centralized error handling middleware
- WebSocket error propagation
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Client-friendly error responses
- Error categorization and routing

### 3. Logging & Observability

- Structured logging framework
- Request/response logging
- WebSocket connection/message logging
- Performance metrics collection
- Audit trail for security events

## Technical Requirements

### Authentication Architecture

```typescript
// Reuse pattern from how-do-you-know-src
@RequirePermissions('chat:room:join')
@RequirePermissions('chat:message:send')
@RequirePermissions('chat:robot:interact')
```

### Database Schema (Adapt from how-do-you-know)

- `users` table with chat-specific fields
- `access_permissions` with chat domain permissions
- `access_permission_groups` (employees, guests, supervisors)
- `access_permission_assignments_user`
- `access_permission_assignments_group`
- `access_permission_group_memberships`

### Permission Domains

```
chat:room:create
chat:room:join
chat:room:invite
chat:message:send
chat:message:view
chat:robot:interact
chat:file:upload
chat:escalation:create
supervisor:room:monitor
supervisor:escalation:assign
```

### Error Categories

- Authentication errors (401, 403)
- WebSocket connection errors
- Business logic errors (room access, guest restrictions)
- System errors (database, external services)
- Robot interaction errors

### Logging Requirements

- Authentication events (login, permission checks)
- WebSocket connections (connect, disconnect, errors)
- Message events (send, receive, robot interactions)
- Room management (create, join, leave, escalate)
- File operations (upload, download, processing)
- Performance metrics (response times, connection counts)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Authentication (Week 1)

1. Adapt user schema from how-do-you-know
2. Implement JWT-based HTTP authentication
3. Create WebSocket JWT validation
4. Build permission decorator system
5. Implement guest vs employee separation

### Phase 2: Error Handling (Week 1-2)

1. Create centralized error handling middleware
2. Implement WebSocket error propagation
3. Build client-friendly error response system
4. Add graceful degradation for system failures

### Phase 3: Logging (Week 2)

1. Set up structured logging framework
2. Implement request/response logging
3. Add WebSocket event logging
4. Create audit trail system
5. Set up performance metrics collection

## Success Criteria

- [ ] JWT authentication working for HTTP and WebSocket
- [ ] Permission system enforcing chat-specific rules
- [ ] Guest users cannot access employee-only features
- [ ] All errors handled gracefully with appropriate responses
- [ ] Comprehensive logging of all system events
- [ ] Audit trail for security-relevant events
- [ ] Performance metrics collection established

## Dependencies & Integration Points

- Database connection and migration system
- Configuration management
- WebSocket server framework selection
- Monitoring/alerting infrastructure

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for authentication logic (>90% coverage)
- Integration tests for permission enforcement
- WebSocket authentication testing
- Error handling scenario testing
- Load testing for authentication performance

## Security Considerations

- JWT token expiration and refresh strategy
- WebSocket connection authentication
- Permission escalation prevention
- Audit logging for compliance
- Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Guest user isolation and protection
