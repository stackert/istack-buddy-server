# Introduction

The robot system provides a framework for AI-powered assistance across various domains and use cases. Robots are specialized AI agents that can handle different types of interactions, from simple testing and development to complex troubleshooting and form management operations.

Each robot is designed with specific capabilities and tools tailored to particular domains, enabling focused and effective assistance for users. The system supports multiple response patterns including immediate responses, streaming responses, and multi-part responses with delayed callbacks.

## Overview

The robot system operates through a centralized service that manages robot registration, discovery, and communication. Robots are designed as pluggable components that can be easily added or removed from the system.

### Robot Architecture

All robots inherit from a common base class that defines the standard interface for message handling and response generation. This architecture ensures consistent behavior while allowing for specialized implementations.

Robots can implement different response patterns depending on their use case:

- Immediate responses for quick interactions
- Streaming responses for real-time feedback
- Multi-part responses with delayed callbacks for complex operations

### Common Capabilities

All robots share certain fundamental capabilities:

- Message processing and response generation
- Token estimation for context management
- Version tracking and identification
- Error handling and logging

### Learning and Improvement

Each robot includes mechanisms for continuous learning and improvement through user feedback and rating systems, in near real-time. This enables robots to become more effective and accurate over time based on user interactions.

### Tool Integration

Many robots have access to specialized tools and knowledge bases that enable them to perform specific tasks. These tools can range from simple utilities to complex API integrations for external services.

### Response Patterns

Robots support various response patterns to accommodate different use cases:

- **Immediate responses** provide instant feedback for simple queries
- **Streaming responses** deliver content in real-time chunks for better user experience
- **Multi-part responses** combine immediate acknowledgment with delayed detailed responses, long running queries, fetching resources or complex data processing.

### Context Management

Robots maintain conversation context to provide relevant and coherent responses across multiple interactions. The system implements a multi-view conversation model where different participants have different levels of access to conversation content. Customer service agents can see all conversation messages, customers see only what agents choose to share, and robots see only robot-specific messages (to/from). This multi-view approach promotes confidence building and quality assurance of robot performance while maintaining appropriate information boundaries.

### Security and Access Control

The robot system includes mechanisms for controlling access to different robots and their capabilities. This ensures that users can only access appropriate functionality based on their permissions and needs.
