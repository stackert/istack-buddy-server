# Robot Architecture Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully separated Formstack functionality from the general-purpose `RobotChatAnthropic` into a specialized `AnthropicMarv` robot.

## Changes Made

### âœ… `RobotChatAnthropic` - Cleaned Up

**Location**: `src/robots/RobotChatAnthropic.ts`  
**Purpose**: General-purpose Forms Core troubleshooting robot

**Retained Tools:**

- `sumo_logic_query` - Analyze form submissions and logs
- `sso_autofill_assistance` - Troubleshoot SSO auto-fill issues

**Removed**: All Formstack API tools (moved to AnthropicMarv)

### âœ… `AnthropicMarv` - New Specialized Robot

**Location**: `src/robots/AnthropicMarv.ts`  
**Purpose**: Specialized Formstack form management robot

**Available Tools (11 total):**

- `fieldRemove` - Remove fields from forms
- `fsRestrictedApiFormLiteAdd` - Create new forms with initial fields
- `fsRestrictedApiFieldLiteAdd` - Add individual fields to forms
- `fsRestrictedApiFormDeveloperCopy` - Create developer copies
- `fsRestrictedApiFieldLabelUniqueSlugAdd/Remove` - Manage field label slugs
- `fsRestrictedApiFieldLogicStashCreate/Apply/ApplyAndRemove/Remove` - Logic backup operations
- `fsRestrictedApiFieldLogicRemove` - Remove all logic from forms

## Architecture Benefits

### ðŸŽ¯ **Separation of Concerns**

- **RobotChatAnthropic**: General troubleshooting, log analysis, SSO issues
- **AnthropicMarv**: Form management, field operations, logic stash operations

### ðŸ”§ **Specialized System Prompts**

- **RobotChatAnthropic**: Forms Core troubleshooting specialist
- **AnthropicMarv**: Formstack API operations specialist with caution warnings

### ðŸš€ **Production Ready**

- Both robots can be used simultaneously for different purposes
- Clear boundaries between troubleshooting vs. form management
- Real API integration with proper error handling

## Summary

âœ… **Successfully separated concerns** between general troubleshooting and form management  
âœ… **Preserved all functionality** while improving organization  
âœ… **Both robots are production-ready** with real API integration  
âœ… **Clear migration path** for remaining demo scripts

The architecture now supports specialized robots for different purposes while maintaining all existing functionality.
