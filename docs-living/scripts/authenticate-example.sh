# Note: In a real scenario, you would need to:
# 1. Get the actual user ID from the database after seeding
# 2. Use a real JWT token from your authentication provider
# 
# For this example, we're using placeholder values that match the 
# development setup described in the authentication module documentation.

# Test user credentials (from seed data)
USER_EMAIL="all-permissions@example.com"
