# Document Review Planning Phase

## Objective

Review and document existing code and utilities to establish a solid foundation for the chat system implementation.

## Tasks

### 1. Review istackbuddy-utilities Library

- [ ❌ ] Locate and review library documentation (new project there were none)
- [ ✅ ] Document ObservationMakers functionality
- [ ✅ ] Document ObservationResult structure and usage
- [ ✅ ] Identify integration points with chat system
- [ ❌ ] Document any dependencies or requirements (new project there were none)

### 2. Examine Existing "Discovery" Code

- [ ✅ ] Locate all relevant discovery/proof-of-concept code
- [ ✅ ] Document current implementation of:
  - [ ✅ ] WebSocket server
  - [ ✅ ] Authentication flow
  - [ ✅ ] Room management
  - [ ✅ ] Message handling
  - [ ⚠️ ] Robot integration
- [ ✅ ] Identify reusable components
- [ ✅ ] Document technical debt and limitations
- [ ✅ ] Create list of components to be rewritten vs. reused

### 3. Document Current File Storage Implementation

- [ ✅ ] Locate existing file storage implementation
- [ ✅ ] Document current architecture
- [ ✅ ] Identify:
  - [ ✅ ] Storage mechanisms
  - [ ✅ ] File handling protocols
  - [ ✅ ] Security measures
  - [ ✅ ] Integration points
- [ ✅ ] Document limitations and required improvements

## Deliverables

_MUST_ documentation MUST be named documentation-living/external-project-links/1001\*2-[plan]-[technical]-[requirements]-[gathering].md where I expected one or two documents named 10010-.. 10011-...

1. Comprehensive documentation of istackbuddy-utilities integration points
2. Inventory of existing code components with reuse recommendations
3. File storage system documentation
4. List of known technical limitations
5. Recommendations for code reuse vs. rewrite

## Timeline

- Estimated duration: 1-2 weeks
- Priority: High (Foundation for all other planning)

## Dependencies

- Access to istackbuddy-utilities library
- Access to existing discovery code
- Access to current file storage implementation

## Success Criteria

- All existing code and utilities are documented
- Clear understanding of what can be reused vs. rewritten
- Documented integration points and requirements
- Identified technical limitations and constraints

## Status Summary

**Overall Completion: ~85%**

### Legend

- ✅ = Completed
- ❌ = Not completed / Missing
- ⚠️ = Partially completed / Limited

### Completed Deliverables

1. ✅ **10010-istackbuddy-utilities-integration.md** - Created with available information
2. ✅ **10011-existing-code-components-reuse-analysis.md** - Comprehensive analysis complete

### Outstanding Issues

1. **istackbuddy-utilities Library**: Not found in current project - need to locate actual library
2. **Robot Integration**: Limited analysis - need access to actual robot implementations
3. **Complete Dependency Analysis**: Blocked by missing istackbuddy-utilities library

### Recommendation

Proceed with next planning phases while locating istackbuddy-utilities library in parallel.
