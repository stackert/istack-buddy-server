# Post Release Security Audit

## Work Overview

This security audit will address the security features that were dismantled due to request routing issues, particularly around hosting static apps within secured directory structures. The focus is on restoring proper security while resolving the underlying routing problems.

## Key Areas to Address

1. **Route Structure Analysis**: Review the current /marv-form routing structure and identify security gaps
2. **Unprotected Resource Review**: Examine /create-test-session and similar unprotected endpoints
3. **Static Content Security**: Assess the security implications of hosting static content in protected directories
4. **Authentication/Authorization Restoration**: Restore proper security middleware and guards

## Expected Deliverables

- Security audit report identifying all current vulnerabilities
- Plan for restructuring unprotected resources (move to /dev-debug/ endpoints)
- Updated route structure with proper security boundaries
- Restored authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Testing strategy for security validation
