# Post Release Fix: Conversation Chat Manager

## Work Overview

Based on the audit findings, this work will implement the necessary fixes to resolve the architectural issues between ChatManager and ConversationListManager. The goal is to establish clear separation of concerns and eliminate data duplication while maintaining system functionality.

## Key Areas to Address

1. **Remove Duplicate Message Storage**: Eliminate ChatManager's internal message list and ensure all messages flow through ConversationListManager
2. **Restructure ChatManager Interactions**: Update all ChatManager methods to properly delegate message operations to ConversationListManager
3. **Update Message Flow**: Ensure all message creation, retrieval, and filtering operations use the single source of truth
4. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing API contracts remain functional during the transition

## Expected Deliverables

- Refactored ChatManager that delegates all message operations to ConversationListManager
- Updated integration points and API endpoints
- Comprehensive test coverage for the new message flow
- Documentation of the new architectural boundaries
