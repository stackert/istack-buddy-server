# Post Release Re-implement Conversation Chat Managers

## Work Overview

This work will implement a clean, well-architected conversation and chat management system with clear separation of concerns. The goal is to create a robust foundation that properly separates Robot, ChatManager, and ConversationManager responsibilities.

## Key Areas to Address

1. **Define Clear Boundaries**: Establish proper separation between Robot (semi-dumb request/response), ChatManager (websocket interaction management), and ConversationManager (message storage and retrieval)
2. **Implement ConversationManager**: Create a new ConversationManager with clear insert, get, and filter message capabilities
3. **Refactor ChatManager**: Restructure ChatManager to focus solely on websocket interactions and delegate message operations
4. **Integration Architecture**: Design clean integration points between all components

## Expected Deliverables

- New ConversationManager with clear message management capabilities
- Refactored ChatManager focused on websocket interactions
- Clean integration architecture between Robot, ChatManager, and ConversationManager
- Comprehensive test coverage for all components
- Documentation of the new architectural patterns
