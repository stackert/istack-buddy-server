# Lifecycle Management Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the conversation lifecycle management system that handles conversation states, garbage collection, and resource cleanup for the chat system.

## Scope

- Conversation lifecycle states
- Inactive conversation detection
- Garbage collection mechanisms
- Resource cleanup procedures
- Phase I vs Phase II lifecycle differences
- Performance optimization through cleanup

## Key Features

### Conversation States

- Active conversation management
- Inactive conversation detection
- Conversation termination criteria
- State transition handling

### Garbage Collection

- Automatic cleanup of inactive conversations
- Configurable TTL for conversation expiration
- Resource reclamation procedures
- Performance impact minimization

### Inactive Detection

- Last message timestamp tracking
- Participant activity monitoring
- Configurable inactivity thresholds (MAX_TTL_INACTIVE_CONVERSATIONS)
- Automated scanning for inactive conversations

### Cleanup Procedures

- Message cleanup for expired conversations
- Room metadata cleanup
- Participant relationship cleanup
- Thread cleanup within expired conversations

## Dependencies

- Room management system
- Message management system
- Storage layer
- Dashboard/monitoring system

## Success Criteria

- Efficient resource utilization
- Prevent system bloat from inactive conversations
- Minimal performance impact from cleanup operations
- Configurable cleanup parameters

## Phase I Considerations

- Short TTL for proof of concept (10 minutes suggested)
- Expectation of frequent conversation creation/destruction
- Slack-originated conversations cleaned up quickly
- No persistence requirements

## Phase II Considerations

- Longer TTL (3-5 days)
- Conversation success/failure tracking
- Archive before deletion
- Knowledge base integration

## Out of Scope

- Manual conversation termination
- Conversation archiving (Phase II)
- Advanced lifecycle analytics
- Conversation success metrics
- User notification of cleanup
