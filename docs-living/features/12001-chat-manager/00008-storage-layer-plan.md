# Storage Layer Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the data storage strategy for the chat system, including database design, data persistence decisions, and performance considerations for Phase I proof of concept.

## Scope

- Database schema design for messages, rooms, users, threads
- Storage strategy (database vs in-memory for Phase I)
- Data relationships and constraints
- Performance optimization for Phase I scale
- Data lifecycle management
- Migration strategy for Phase II

## Key Features

### Data Models

- Message storage with visibility attributes
- Room/conversation metadata
- User/participant relationships
- Thread association and hierarchy
- Message sharing/duplication tracking

### Storage Strategy

- Phase I: Leverage existing database infrastructure
- Consider in-memory storage for performance
- Temporary storage approach for proof of concept
- Plan for Phase II migration to production storage

### Data Relationships

- Message-to-room associations
- User-to-room participant relationships
- Message threading relationships
- Original/duplicated message tracking

### Performance Considerations

- Optimize for Phase I limits (10 users, 100 conversations, 25 messages)
- Index strategy for message retrieval
- Query optimization for visibility filtering
- Garbage collection support

## Dependencies

- Existing database infrastructure
- Message management system requirements
- Room management system requirements
- Threading system requirements

## Success Criteria

- Support Phase I scalability requirements
- Efficient message retrieval and filtering
- Clean data model for future expansion
- Minimal performance impact on existing system

## Out of Scope

- Production-scale database optimization
- Advanced caching strategies
- Database replication/clustering
- Backup and recovery procedures (use existing system)
- Data archiving (Phase II feature)
- Advanced indexing strategies
