# Help Command Implementation

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

The help command has been successfully added to provide users with comprehensive information about what iStackBuddy can do and how to use it.

## üõ†Ô∏è What Was Built

### 1. Abstract Method in AbstractRobot

- Added `getUserHelpText()` method to `AbstractRobot` base class
- Provides generic default implementation for all robots
- Can be overridden by specific robot implementations

### 2. SlackyAnthropicAgent Override

- Specialized help text for Slacky's capabilities
- Details about Forms Core troubleshooting expertise
- Information about advanced analysis tools
- Knowledge base coverage by channel
- Usage examples and specialized features

### 3. Direct Command Integration

- Added help keyword detection to `handleDirectFeedbackCommands`
- Pattern: `@istack-buddy /help`
- Returns help text immediately without LLM API calls
- Works in all contexts (channels, threads, DMs)

## üéØ Features

### Command Usage

```
@istack-buddy /help
```

### Help Content Includes

- **Robot Identity** - Name and specialization
- **Capabilities** - What problems it can solve
- **Advanced Tools** - Available analysis tools
- **Knowledge Base Coverage** - Channel-specific expertise
- **Usage Examples** - How to ask questions and give feedback
- **Specialized Features** - Unique capabilities

### Knowledge Base Information

The help text explains that Slacky is backed by different knowledge bases:

- **#forms-sso** ‚Üí Forms SSO-specific knowledge base
- **#cx-formstack** ‚Üí General Forms Core knowledge base
- **Other channels** ‚Üí General troubleshooting knowledge

## üìä Usage Examples

### Getting Help

```
User: @istack-buddy /help
iStackBuddy: ü§ñ **iStackBuddy (Slacky) - Help**

I'm your AI assistant specialized in **Intellistack Forms Core** troubleshooting and support.

## üõ†Ô∏è **What I Can Help With:**

**Forms Core Troubleshooting:**
‚Ä¢ SSO troubleshooting (Forms Password Protected/SSO Protected)
‚Ä¢ Form configuration issues (fields, sections, visibility logic)
[... complete help text ...]
```

### In Context Usage

```
User: I'm not sure what you can do
User: @istack-buddy /help
iStackBuddy: [shows comprehensive help information]

User: @istack-buddy Can you analyze submission logs for form 12345?
iStackBuddy: [proceeds with analysis using available tools]
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Slack Mention Format Support ‚úÖ FIXED

The regex patterns support **both** mention formats:

- **Manual format:** `@istack-buddy /command` (for testing/manual typing)
- **Slack mention format:** `<@USERID> /command` (actual Slack mentions)

When users type `@istack-buddy` in Slack, it gets converted to `<@U123456789>` format where U123456789 is the bot's actual user ID. The regex patterns use `(?:@istack-buddy|<@[^>]+>)` to detect both formats.

### AbstractRobot Base Method

```typescript
public getUserHelpText(): string {
  return `ü§ñ **${this.name} - Help**

I'm a general-purpose AI assistant robot. Here's what I can help you with:

**Basic Capabilities:**
‚Ä¢ Answer questions and provide information
‚Ä¢ Help with troubleshooting and problem-solving
‚Ä¢ Provide explanations and guidance

**Technical Details:**
‚Ä¢ Model: ${this.LLModelName} (${this.LLModelVersion})
‚Ä¢ Context Window: ${this.contextWindowSizeInTokens.toLocaleString()} tokens

For more specific capabilities, please see the robot implementation documentation.`;
}
```

### SlackyAnthropicAgent Override

- Comprehensive help text specific to Forms Core troubleshooting
- Details about available tools and capabilities
- Channel-specific knowledge base information
- Usage examples for questions, feedback, and ratings

### Command Detection

```typescript
// Check for @istack-buddy /help pattern (supports both @istack-buddy and <@USERID> formats)
const helpMatch = trimmedMessage.match(
  /(?:@istack-buddy|<@[^>]+>)\s+\/help\b/i,
);
if (helpMatch) {
  return this.getUserHelpText();
}
```

## üöÄ Benefits

1. **Self-Documenting** - Users can discover capabilities without external docs
2. **Context Aware** - Help is specific to the robot's actual capabilities
3. **Channel Context** - Explains knowledge base differences by channel
4. **Immediate Response** - No LLM API calls needed for help
5. **Comprehensive** - Covers all aspects from basic usage to advanced features
6. **Extensible** - Easy to update as new capabilities are added

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

- **Dynamic Help** - Context-aware help based on current channel
- **Interactive Help** - Follow-up questions based on user needs
- **Help Categories** - Specific help for different types of issues
- **Usage Analytics** - Track which help sections are most useful

## üéâ Status: Ready for Use

The help command is **fully functional** and provides comprehensive guidance for users. It integrates seamlessly with the existing direct command system and provides valuable self-documentation for the SlackyAnthropicAgent's capabilities.

**Usage:** Simply type `@istack-buddy /help` in any Slack channel, thread, or DM to get complete information about what iStackBuddy can do and how to use it effectively.
