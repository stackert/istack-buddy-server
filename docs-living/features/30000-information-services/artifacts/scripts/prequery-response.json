Submit Actions are designed to run after a submission is received, and they can be categorized as either blocking or queued actions. Blocking actions execute inline during the submission process and can impact the user experience if they fail, potentially aborting the submission. On the other hand, queued actions run asynchronously after the initial processing. If the Webhooks are not triggering, it is essential to check the logs for any errors related to the Submit Actions. The initial run of Submit Actions uses request-time values, while a re-run uses stored values, which may differ in formatting. If the Webhooks are failing during the re-run, it could indicate that the stored values do not meet the expected format for the integration. Additionally, connectivity issues, such as network timeouts or misconfigured endpoints, could also prevent the Webhooks from executing. It is advisable to review the Sumo Logic logs for any error messages related to the specific form and submission ID to identify the root cause of the issue. Furthermore, ensure that the form's submission settings allow for the storage of submissions, as this can affect the execution of Submit Actions.","chunks":[{"index":0,"chunk_text":"A customer is reporting an issue with the Formstack platform where the configured Submit Actions (Integrations  |  Webhooks) are not executing as expected after form submissions.
